            <p >We have already written an article on Swami Vivekananda’s quotes on mind. Now in this article we’ll make a collection of Swami Vivekananda‘s quotes and comments on mind.</p>
            <p>
            lways keep your mind joyful; if melancholy thoughts come, kick them out.[Source]
By dint of hard work, thoughts may be silenced altogether.[Source]
Even thinking the least good of others gradually instils into the heart the strength of a lion.[Source]
Every new thought must create opposition.[Source]
Every thought in the mind has a form as its counterpart. This is called in Sanskrit philosophy Nâma-Rupa — name and form.[Source]</p>
<p>
If you have to think, think good thoughts, great thoughts.[Source]
In our little universe, this human mind, we see a thought arise. Whence it arises we do not know; and when it disappears, where it goes, we know not either.[Source]
Mere thoughts are like little wavelets.[Source]
Our thoughts make things beautiful, our thoughts make things ugly.[Source]
The thought is followed by the word, and the word by the form.[Source]</p>
<p>
There is a great tendency in modern times to talk too much of work and decry thought. Doing is very good, but that comes from thinking. Little manifestations of energy through the muscles are called work. But where there is no thought, there will be no work. Fill the brain, therefore, with high thoughts, highest ideals, place them day and night before you, and out of that will come great work. Talk not about impurity, but say that we are pure. We have hypnotised ourselves into this thought that we are little, that we are born, and that we are going to die, and into a constant state of fear.[Source]</p>
<p>
Thinking beings must differ; difference is the first sign of thought. If I am a thoughtful man, certainly I ought to like to live amongst thoughtful persons where there are differences of opinion.[Source]
Thought ceases in meditation; even the mind’s elements are quite quiet. Blood circulation stops. His breath stops, but he is not dead.[Source]</p>
<p>Thought is all important, for “what we think we become”.[Source]
Thought is like a bubble rising to the surface. When thought is joined to will, we call it power.[Source]
Thought is the finest and highest action of Prana.[Source]
Thoughts can be guided and controlled.[Source]
We are the heirs of good and evil thought.[Source]
We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care of what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live, they travel far. Each thought we think is tinged with our own character, so that for the pure and holy man, even his jests or abuse will have the twist of his own love and purity and do good.[Source]
What we think we tend to become.[Source]</p>
<p>Whatever we are now is the result of our acts and thoughts in the past; and whatever we shall be in the future will be the result of what we think end do now.[Source]
Whatever you dream and think of, you create.[Source]
Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak you will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be; if you think yourselves impure, impure you will be; if you think yourselves pure, pure you will be.[Source]
When this variation in thought is kept up, we must exist; and we need not quarrel because of that variety.[Source]</p>
